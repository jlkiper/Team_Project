# Team_Project
To summarize our project, we worked on a dataset that covered the IBM companyâ€™s human resources analytics based on their employees. This seems to be a yearly coverage for HR to cover their employees and keep track of how they are doing within the workplace. The machine learning model used for this data analysis was the K-Nearest Neighbor model which classifies new instances based on a similarity measure. This dataset contains 1471 samples with 32 columns with various data types. Our three experiments were split into models based on training the data, validating it, and testing the final percentage. This includes splits of 80/10/10, 70/15/15, and 50/25/25. To conclude on what was found, using this model gave us messy results with the dataset used. This is most likely due to the dataset being fictional. However, out of the three models created using this dataset, we were able to see the relationship between the previously stated variables used for the models.
